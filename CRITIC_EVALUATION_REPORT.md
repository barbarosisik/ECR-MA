# Critic Model Evaluation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the training and evaluation of a multi-head critic model for the Empathetic Conversational Recommender (ECR) system. The critic was designed to evaluate response quality across multiple dimensions: empathy, informativeness, recommendation quality, engagement, overall quality, and BLEU score.

## Project Timeline

1. **Data Preparation**: Created synthetic quality labels using Llama2-Chat
2. **Model Training**: Trained a multi-head critic using supervised learning
3. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation with visualizations and metrics analysis

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: RoBERTa-base transformer
- **Architecture**: Multi-head critic with 6 output heads
- **Input**: Context-response pairs
- **Output**: Quality scores for 6 metrics
- **Training**: Supervised learning with MSE loss

## Training Details

- **Dataset**: `llama2_scored_rich.jsonl` (14 samples) - **OUTDATED, TOO SMALL**
- **Model**: `critic_pretrained_rich/critic_pretrained_final.pth`
- **Training Duration**: 5 epochs
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-05
- **Batch Size**: 4
- **Optimizer**: Adam with linear warmup

## Current Status: UPGRADING TO FULL DATASET

- **Real Dataset**: `ECRHMAS/data/redial_gen/train_data_processed.jsonl` (56,355 samples)
- **New Scoring Pipeline**: Running Llama2-Chat on full dataset to generate quality scores
- **Expected Output**: `llama2_scored_full_dataset.jsonl` with 6 quality metrics per sample

## Evaluation Results

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | MSE | MAE | R¬≤ | Performance |
|--------|-----|-----|----|-------------|
| Empathy | 0.000241 | 0.015452 | 0.0000 | Very Poor |
| Informativeness | 0.002122 | 0.046000 | 0.0000 | Very Poor |
| Recommendation | 0.000601 | 0.024444 | 0.0000 | Very Poor |
| Engagement | 0.002122 | 0.046000 | 0.0000 | Very Poor |
| Overall | 0.003488 | 0.059001 | 0.0000 | Very Poor |
| BLEU | 0.000202 | 0.014143 | 0.0000 | Very Poor |
| **OVERALL** | **0.001463** | **0.034173** | **0.0000** | **Very Poor** |

### Key Findings

1. **Zero Correlation**: All R¬≤ values are 0.0, indicating no correlation between predictions and ground truth
2. **Low Variance Predictions**: The model appears to be predicting conservative, low-variance scores
3. **Underfitting**: The model may not have learned meaningful patterns from the training data

## Generated Visualizations

The evaluation produced 5 comprehensive visualization plots:

1. **overall_performance.png**: Scatter plots showing prediction vs ground truth for each metric
2. **metrics_comparison.png**: Bar charts comparing MSE, MAE, and R¬≤ across metrics
3. **distributions.png**: Histograms showing the distribution of predictions vs ground truth
4. **correlation_heatmap.png**: Correlation matrix between all predictions and ground truth
5. **error_analysis.png**: Error distribution analysis for each metric

## Issues Identified

### 1. Synthetic Data Quality
- The synthetic labels generated by Llama2-Chat may not be representative of real quality metrics
- Limited dataset size (14 samples) is insufficient for meaningful training
- Synthetic scores may lack the variance and nuance of human annotations

### 2. Model Architecture
- The current architecture may not be optimal for the task
- The model may be overfitting to the limited training data
- The loss function may need adjustment for multi-head learning

### 3. Training Process
- Limited training data leads to poor generalization
- The model may need more epochs or different learning strategies
- Validation on synthetic data may not reflect real-world performance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Increase Dataset Size**: Collect more training samples (aim for 1000+ samples)
2. **Human Annotations**: Replace synthetic labels with real human quality assessments
3. **Data Diversity**: Ensure training data covers diverse conversation scenarios

### Model Improvements
1. **Architecture Experimentation**: Try different model architectures (BERT, GPT, etc.)
2. **Loss Function**: Experiment with different loss functions for multi-head learning
3. **Regularization**: Add dropout and other regularization techniques
4. **Learning Rate**: Try different learning rate schedules

### Evaluation Enhancements
1. **Real-world Testing**: Evaluate on actual conversation data
2. **Human Evaluation**: Compare model predictions with human judgments
3. **Ablation Studies**: Test individual components of the model

## Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ Data Collection**: **IN PROGRESS** - Running Llama2-Chat scoring on full dataset (56K samples)
2. **üîÑ Model Retraining**: **PENDING** - Will retrain critic on new full dataset once scoring completes
3. **‚è≥ RL Integration**: **PENDING** - Will integrate improved critic into RL training loop
4. **‚è≥ End-to-End Evaluation**: **PENDING** - Will test complete ECR system with improved critic

## Current Execution Plan

### Step 1: ‚úÖ Full Dataset Scoring (IN PROGRESS)
- **Job ID**: 4436448 (submitted)
- **Dataset**: 56,355 conversation samples
- **Output**: `llama2_scored_full_dataset.jsonl`
- **Status**: Running on ALICE cluster

### Step 2: üîÑ Retrain Critic on Full Dataset (PENDING)
- **Input**: New `llama2_scored_full_dataset.jsonl`
- **Expected**: Much better critic performance
- **Timeline**: After scoring job completes

### Step 3: üîÑ Evaluate New Critic (PENDING)
- **Test**: Use improved test scripts
- **Expected**: Meaningful quality distinctions
- **Validation**: Real conversation data

## Conclusion

While the current critic model shows very poor performance, this evaluation provides valuable insights for improvement. The main issues are the limited dataset size and the use of synthetic labels. With a larger, human-annotated dataset and architectural improvements, the critic has the potential to become an effective component of the ECR system.

The evaluation framework established here can be reused for future iterations of the critic model, enabling systematic improvement and validation of the ECR system's response quality assessment capabilities.
