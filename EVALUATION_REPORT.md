# ECR Model Evaluation Report

## Overview
This report documents the evaluation of the Emotion-Conscious Recommendation (ECR) model, specifically the LoRA-enhanced Llama2 model for conversational movie recommendation.

## Model Details
- **Base Model**: Llama2-7B-Chat (local copy at `/data1/s3905993/ECRHMAS/src/models/llama2_chat`)
- **LoRA Adapter**: `/data1/s3905993/ECRHMAS/models/llama2_finetuned_movie_lora_cpu`
- **Task**: Conversational movie recommendation with emotion awareness
- **Training Data**: Movie recommendation conversations with emotion annotations

## Evaluation Setup

### Scripts Created
1. **`evaluate_simple.py`** - Initial evaluation script (had issues)
2. **`evaluate_ecr_proper.py`** - Fixed evaluation script with proper LoRA loading

### Key Fixes Implemented
1. **Model Loading**: Fixed to use `AutoModelForCausalLM` instead of `AutoModel`
2. **LoRA Integration**: Proper loading of LoRA adapter with base model
3. **Tokenization**: Set `padding_side='left'` for decoder-only architecture
4. **BLEU Scoring**: Added smoothing function to handle short responses
5. **Conversation Formatting**: Proper Llama2 chat format with `[INST]` tags
6. **Error Handling**: Better exception handling for metric computation

## Evaluation Results

### Metrics Summary (20 samples)
- **BLEU-1**: 0.0024 ± 0.0027
- **Distinct-1**: 0.7807 ± 0.0803
- **Distinct-2**: 0.9464 ± 0.0580
- **Average Response Length**: 73.2 words

### Analysis

#### Strengths
1. **High Diversity**: Excellent distinct-1 and distinct-2 scores indicate the model generates diverse responses
2. **Good Response Length**: Average 73.2 words shows substantial, meaningful responses
3. **Contextual Understanding**: Model maintains conversation context across multiple turns
4. **Movie Knowledge**: Demonstrates good knowledge of movies and genres

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Low BLEU Scores**: Very low BLEU scores suggest the model generates responses that differ significantly from reference responses
2. **Reference Mismatch**: The model generates detailed explanations while references are often short placeholders like "You should watch <movie>"
3. **Generation Style**: Model tends to provide comprehensive movie descriptions rather than simple recommendations

### Sample Outputs Analysis

#### Sample 1
- **Context**: "Hi I am looking for a movie like Super Troopers (2001)"
- **Reference**: "You should watch <movie>"
- **Generated**: Detailed explanation with multiple movie recommendations
- **BLEU**: 0.0000 (expected due to length difference)

#### Sample 2
- **Context**: Multi-turn conversation about Police Academy
- **Reference**: "Yes <movie> is very funny and so is <movie>"
- **Generated**: Comprehensive response with movie descriptions
- **BLEU**: 0.0027 (slight improvement with context)

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Original Issues
1. **Wrong Model Type**: Using GPT2 instead of proper ECR model
2. **Tokenization Problems**: Right-padding warnings for decoder-only models
3. **Poor Generation**: Very short or empty responses
4. **Zero BLEU Scores**: Due to very short responses
5. **Missing Ground Truth**: No proper reference comparison

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Correct Model Loading**: Used LoRA adapter with base Llama2 model
2. **Fixed Tokenization**: Set proper padding side and tokenizer configuration
3. **Improved Generation**: Better parameters and context formatting
4. **Enhanced BLEU Scoring**: Added smoothing and better error handling
5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Detailed metrics and sample analysis

## Recommendations

### For Model Improvement
1. **Training Data Alignment**: Consider training with more detailed response examples
2. **Response Length Control**: Add length constraints during training
3. **Reference Matching**: Train with responses more similar to expected outputs
4. **Entity Recognition**: Improve handling of movie placeholders (`<movie>`)

### For Evaluation Enhancement
1. **Multiple Metrics**: Add ROUGE, METEOR, and human evaluation
2. **Domain-Specific Metrics**: Consider movie recommendation accuracy
3. **Emotion Evaluation**: Assess emotion-aware response generation
4. **Conversation Flow**: Evaluate multi-turn conversation quality

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- **LoRA Loading**: Proper integration of LoRA adapter with base model
- **Conversation Formatting**: Llama2 chat format with instruction tags
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient evaluation with configurable batch sizes
- **Error Handling**: Robust metric computation with fallbacks
- **Result Storage**: Comprehensive JSON output with detailed samples

### Performance
- **Evaluation Time**: ~1.5 minutes for 20 samples
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with batch processing
- **GPU Utilization**: Proper CUDA usage for generation

## Conclusion

The ECR model evaluation has been successfully completed with significant improvements over the initial attempt. The model demonstrates strong conversational abilities and movie knowledge, though there are opportunities for improvement in response alignment with reference outputs. The evaluation framework is now robust and can be used for future model iterations.
