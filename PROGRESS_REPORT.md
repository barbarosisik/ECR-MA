# ECR-MA Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
Enhancing an Empathetic Conversational Recommender (ECR) system with a better critic agent using reinforcement learning. The goal is to improve response quality through a multi-head critic model that evaluates empathy, informativeness, recommendation quality, engagement, overall quality, and BLEU scores.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Data Preparation & Quality Labeling
- **‚úÖ Created Llama2 prompt generation system** (`llama2_score_responses.py`)
- **‚úÖ Generated synthetic quality scores** for testing (14 samples)
- **‚úÖ Created rich-context dataset** with quality labels (`llama2_scored_rich.jsonl`)
- **‚úÖ Completed full dataset scoring with Llama2** (56,355 samples)
- **‚úÖ Set up Mistral7B-Instruct scoring system** with 4-bit quantization
- **‚ùå Tested DialoGPT-large but found unsuitable** for structured scoring tasks

### 2. Critic Model Development
- **‚úÖ Designed 6-head critic architecture** (empathy, informativeness, recommendation, engagement, overall, BLEU)
- **‚úÖ Implemented critic model** (`src_emo/rl/critic.py`)
- **‚úÖ Created supervised training script** (`train_critic_supervised.py`)
- **‚úÖ Trained critic on synthetic data** (14 samples) - Model saved in `critic_pretrained_rich/`

### 3. Evaluation & Analysis
- **‚úÖ Created evaluation scripts** (`eval_critic_visualize.py`, `test_6head_critic.py`)
- **‚úÖ Generated evaluation visualizations** (saved in `critic_evaluation_plots/`)
- **‚úÖ Produced evaluation report** (`CRITIC_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`)
- **‚úÖ Identified model performance issues** (R¬≤=0, poor variance in predictions)

### 4. Infrastructure & Scripts
- **‚úÖ Set up SLURM job management** for cluster computing
- **‚úÖ Created monitoring scripts** for training progress
- **‚úÖ Implemented ETA reporting** for long-running jobs
- **‚úÖ Fixed conda environment issues** and package dependencies

## üö® Recent Fixes
- Fixed RL model saving issue (tensor sharing error) by using `safe_serialization=False`.
- Lowered RL checkpoint save frequency to every 100 steps for better checkpointing.
- Mixtral8x7B and DialoGPT-large were abandoned due to technical and hardware issues.

## üö® Recent Major Change
- The system now uses **Llama2-Chat as the ONLY backbone** for response generation (no DialoGPT).
- All training, inference, and evaluation are aligned with the ECR paper's Llama2-Chat structure and prompt format.
- Data: Llama2-annotated emotional data (`llama_train.json`, `llama_test.json`).

## ‚è© Immediate Next Steps
1. Retrain RL for at least 1 epoch to confirm model and checkpoint saving.
2. Test the RL-enhanced model with a test/inference script.
3. Update all documentation files to reflect the new status.

## üìö MACRS Paper Analysis

### Model Selection Validation
Our model selection aligns with the successful MACRS paper approach:

**MACRS Paper Results:**
