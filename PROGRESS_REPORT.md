# ECR-MA Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
Enhancing an Empathetic Conversational Recommender (ECR) system with a better critic agent using reinforcement learning. The goal is to improve response quality through a multi-head critic model that evaluates empathy, informativeness, recommendation quality, engagement, overall quality, and BLEU scores.

## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Data Preparation & Quality Labeling
- **✅ Created Llama2 prompt generation system** (`llama2_score_responses.py`)
- **✅ Generated synthetic quality scores** for testing (14 samples)
- **✅ Created rich-context dataset** with quality labels (`llama2_scored_rich.jsonl`)
- **✅ Currently running full dataset scoring** (56,355 samples) - ~12.7 hours estimated

### 2. Critic Model Development
- **✅ Designed 6-head critic architecture** (empathy, informativeness, recommendation, engagement, overall, BLEU)
- **✅ Implemented critic model** (`src_emo/rl/critic.py`)
- **✅ Created supervised training script** (`train_critic_supervised.py`)
- **✅ Trained critic on synthetic data** (14 samples) - Model saved in `critic_pretrained_rich/`

### 3. Evaluation & Analysis
- **✅ Created evaluation scripts** (`eval_critic_visualize.py`, `test_6head_critic.py`)
- **✅ Generated evaluation visualizations** (saved in `critic_evaluation_plots/`)
- **✅ Produced evaluation report** (`CRITIC_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`)
- **✅ Identified model performance issues** (R²=0, poor variance in predictions)

### 4. Infrastructure & Scripts
- **✅ Set up SLURM job management** for cluster computing
- **✅ Created monitoring scripts** for training progress
- **✅ Implemented ETA reporting** for long-running jobs
- **✅ Fixed conda environment issues** and package dependencies
