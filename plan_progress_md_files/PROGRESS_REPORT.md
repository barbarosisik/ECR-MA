# ECR-MA Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
Enhancing an Empathetic Conversational Recommender (ECR) system with a better critic agent using reinforcement learning. The goal is to improve response quality through a multi-head critic model that evaluates empathy, informativeness, recommendation quality, engagement, overall quality, and BLEU scores.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

- **‚úÖ Created Llama2 prompt generation system** (`llama2_score_responses.py`)
- **‚úÖ Generated synthetic quality scores** for testing (14 samples)
- **‚úÖ Created rich-context dataset** with quality labels (`llama2_scored_rich.jsonl`)
- **‚úÖ Completed full dataset scoring with Llama2** (56,355 samples)
- **‚úÖ Set up Mistral7B-Instruct scoring system** with 4-bit quantization
- **‚ùå Tested DialoGPT-large but found unsuitable** for structured scoring tasks

### 2. Critic Model Development
- **‚úÖ Designed 6-head critic architecture** (empathy, informativeness, recommendation, engagement, overall, BLEU)
- **‚úÖ Implemented critic model** (`src_emo/rl/critic.py`)
- **‚úÖ Created supervised training script** (`train_critic_supervised.py`)
- **‚úÖ Trained critic on synthetic data** (14 samples) - Model saved in `critic_pretrained_rich/`

### 3. Evaluation & Analysis

- **‚úÖ Generated evaluation visualizations** (saved in `critic_evaluation_plots/`)
- **‚úÖ Produced evaluation report** (`CRITIC_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`)
- **‚úÖ Identified model performance issues** (R¬≤=0, poor variance in predictions)

### 4. Infrastructure & Scripts
- **‚úÖ Set up SLURM job management** for cluster computing
- **‚úÖ Created monitoring scripts** for training progress
- **‚úÖ Implemented ETA reporting** for long-running jobs

- **MACRS-L (Llama2-based)**: 48% success rate, 4.49 average turns
